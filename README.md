# Iceriver Monitor Tool


I did a virus-total test, it is interesting that some antiviruses show that there is a Trojan here))
I will think about whether to give the source code publicly, but for now you can familiarize yourself with all the work of the program on the site

At the moment, everything is configured only under KSpro
I don't have other icerivers to test

After adding the first worker, you need to restart the program so that it starts making requests, then all other workers should be added normally, if requests for workers do not come, you need to add them all, restart the program and everything will work. I will fix this in future versions
